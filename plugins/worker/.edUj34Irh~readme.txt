A better way to manage dozens of WordPress websites.

== Description ==

So you're looking for a better way to manage WordPress websites? We have you covered! [ManageWP](https://managewp.com/ "Manage Multiple WordPress Websites") is a dashboard that helps you save time and nerves by automating your workflow, so you could focus on things that matter. It is fast, secure and free for an unlimited number of websites.

= Everything in One Place =
Just the hassle of logging into each of your websites is enough to ruin your day. ManageWP compiles the data from all of your sites on one dashboard, so you can check up on your websites in a single glance. And if you need to take a better look at a particular website, you're just a click away. [Read more](https://managewp.com/features/1-click-login "1-click login")

= Bulk actions =
57 updates on 12 sites? Update them all with a single click. And it's not just updates. Clean spam, database overhead, run security checks and more - with just one click you can do these things on all your websites at once. [Read more](https://managewp.com/features/manage-plugins-and-themes "Manage plugins & themes")

= Cloud Backup that just works =
A reliable backup is the backbone of any business. And we have a free monthly backup for all of your websites. It's, incremental, reliable, and works where other backup solutions fail. The free Backup includes monthly scheduled backup, off-site storage, 1-click restore, US/EU storage choice and the option to exclude files and folders. The premium Backup gives you on-demand backups, weekly/daily/hourly backup cycles & [more](https://managewp.com/features/backup "ManageWP Backup").

= Safe updates =
Updating plugins & themes is a huge pain, so we came with this: a backup is automatically created before each update. After the update, the system checks the website and rolls back automatically if something's wrong. And the best part is that you can set these updates to run at 3am, when the website traffic as its lowest.

= Client Report =
Summarize your hard work in a professional looking report and send it to your clients to showcase your work. The free Client Report includes basic customization and on-demand reports. The premium Client Report lets you white label and automate your reports. [Read more](https://managewp.com/features/backup "Client Report")

= Performance and Security Checks =
Slow or infected websites are bad for business. Luckily, you can now keep tabs on your websites with regular performance & security checks. The free [Security Check](https://managewp.com/features/security-check "security check") & [Performance Check](https://managewp.com/features/performance-scan "performance check") come with fully functional checks and logging. Premium versions let you fully automate the checks, and get an SMS or an email if something's wrong.

= Google Analytics integration =
Connect multiple Google Analytics accounts, and keep track of all the important metrics from one place.  [Read more](https://managewp.com/features/analytics "Google Analytics integration")

= Uptime Monitor (premium add-on) =
Be the first to know when your website is down with both email and SMS notifications, and get your website back online before anyone else notices. [Read more](https://managewp.com/features/uptime-monitor "Uptime Monitor")

= Cloning & Migration (bundled with premium Backup add-on) =
What used to take you hours of work and nerves of steel is now a one-click operation. Pick a source website, pick a destination website, click Go. Within minutes, youw website will be alive and kicking on a new server. Yeah, it's that easy. [Read more](https://managewp.com/features/clone "Cloning & migration")

= SEO Ranking (premium add-on) =
Be on top of your website rankings and figure out which keywords work best for you, as well as keeping on eye on your competitors. This way you will know how well you stack up against them. [Read more](https://managewp.com/features/seo-ranking "SEO Ranking")

= White Label (premium add-on) =
Rename or completely hide the ManageWP Worker plugin. Clients don’t need to know what you are using to manage their websites. [Read more](https://managewp.com/features/white-label "White Label")

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is ManageWP free? =

ManageWP is using the freemium model. All the core features are free for an unlimited number of websites. And for those of you who need more, we have a set of premium features to help you out.

= Do you offer support for free users? =

Yes. No matter if you're free or premium user, we are here for you 24/7. Expect a 1h average response time and a 65% answer resolution in the first reply.

= How much do premium ManageWP features cost? =

Our pricing is highly flexible, we don't charge anything upfront. The usage is calculated on a per-website, per-addon basis, like Amazon Web Services. Check out our [pricing page](https://managewp.com/pricing "ManageWP pricing page") for more info.

= Is ManageWP secure? =

Yes. All of our code is developed in-house and we have a top notch security team. With half a million websites managed since 2012 we did not have a single security incident. We've accomplished this through high standards, vigilance and the help of security researchers, through our [white hat security program](https://managewp.com/white-hat-reward).

= I have websites on several different hosts. Will ManageWP work all of them? =

Yes. ManageWP plays nice with all major hosts, and 99% of the small ones.

= Does ManageWP work with multisites? =

Yes, multisite networks are fully supported, including the ability to backup and clone a multisite network.

= Does ManageWP work with WordPress.com sites? =

No. ManageWP works only with self-hosted WordPress sites.

= Worker plugin can connect to ManageWP and Pro Sites. What is the difference between the two? =

[ManageWP](https://managewp.com "ManageWP website") is focused on the hosting-agnostic WordPress website management. [Pro Sites](https://www.godaddy.com/pro "GoDaddy Pro Sites website") is the GoDaddy version of the service. It's part of the GoDaddy Pro program, which incorporates different tools for website & client management, lead generation, and tighter integration with other GoDaddy products.

= I have problems adding my site =

Make sure you use the latest version of the Worker plugin on the site you are trying to add. If you still have problems, check our dedicated [FAQ page](https://managewp.com/troubleshooting/site-connection/why-cant-i-add-some-of-my-sites "Add site FAQ") or [contact us](https://managewp.com/contact "ManageWP Contact").

= How does ManageWP compare to backup plugins like BackupBuddy, Backwpup, UpdraftPlus, WP-DB-Backup ? =

There is a limit to what a PHP based backup can do, that's why we've built a completely different backup - cloud based, incremental, it keeps working long after others have failed.

= How does ManageWP compare with clone plugins like Duplicator, WP Migrate DB, All-in-One WP Migration, XCloner ? =

These solutions are simple A-B cloning solutions that tend to break in critical moments. ManageWP does it more intelligently. We first upload the backup archive to a cloud infrastructure that we control, and then we transfer it to the destination website. This effectively compartmentalizes the process into two separate steps, making the whole cloning experience much more robust and stress free.

= Is Worker PHP7 compatible? =

Yes, ManageWP Worker is fully compatible with PHP7. We also have chunks of backward compatible code, that triggers in case you're still running PHP5.x - if your code check comes up with a compatibility flag, just ignore it.
