A customizable front end user management plugin for membership sites. Use shortcodes for registration, login, restricting access, membership fees, etc

== Description ==

<a href='http://www.etoilewebdesign.com/front-end-only-users-demo/'>Front-End Users Demo</a>

Front-End Only Users is a user management and membership plugin that allows for front-end user registration and login, and for admins to restrict access to portions of their websites to certain users. No need to give access to your WordPress dashboard (unless you want to). Set different user roles / user levels for specific content restriction.

<strong>Tested with WordPress 5.0!</strong>

<strong>New Gutenberg blocks included for the following features: register, login, logout, user search, user list, edit account, forgot password and confirm forgot password!</strong>

= Front End User Key Features =
* Customizable membership fields for front-end user registration
* Pure CSS-styled front-end login form, user registration form and edit profile form
* Front-end users supports all input types for fields, allowing you to create a custom user profile
* Include different front end user levels / user roles and restrict access to content accordingly
* Option to send sign-up emails and to require admin approval of frontend users
* Front-end user input-based redirects

Simply insert the user registration shortcode below on any page to create a user registration form, allowing visitors to sign up as users on the front end of your site. User level selection is also available on registration.

`
[register]
`

Signing up as front end users can either require a one-time paid membership, recurring monthly or annual membership payments, or it can be free. The front end users are separate from the standard WordPress users, so they have no access to the back end of your site. And by setting up specific user levels, you can restrict access of different pages to specific users. Also, user management is simple and effective with the different frontend user levels / user roles available. Additionally, there are bulk user import and user export features, via spreadsheet, to make user management and getting started with front-end users even easier.

Ideal for paid content, membership, dating sites and more!

Front-End Only Users is completely customizable using CSS and is easily personalized. The available registration shortcode, login shortcode and other user shortcodes, can be used to insert registration forms, login forms, edit profile forms and many more forms on any page of your website. You can also make use of shortcodes for content restriction, to restrict access to frontend users who are logged in and even to specific user levels.

`
[login]
`

Insert the login shortcode above on any page to display a login form, allowing front end users to log in to access restricted content.

`
[restricted]Content to restrict goes here[/restricted]
`

Any content placed between the restricted shortcodes above will only be shown to users who are logged in. Further options are available to restrict access to only those front end users who are a specific user level or who have a specific value for a custom user field.

Create different user fields in the registration form for members to fill out and customize content based on their profiles. User shortcodes are available to display front-end user profiles or allow visitors to perform a user search. Customize forms with CSS to suit your user management needs using the Admin panel.

Need to set up a paid subscription? Front-End Only Users includes paid membership features that can be broken down by user level, so that different pay user levels can have different restricted access on your site. The included custom user role features allow you to restrict access to different portions of your site to different frontend user groups. These access levels provide a user management experience that makes it easy to set up a paid membership site, monetize your content and segment your users!

Type any shortcode name and help (ex:[login help) in any WordPress page to get a complete list of the shortcode's attributes.

= Front End User Additional Features =

* Front end user notifications: Fully customizable set of user emails. Create as many unique email messages as you want and then assign the message of your choice to specific actions (e.g. email to user on sign-up, email to admin on user registration, approval email to the user, forgot password email, etc.)
* Send front end user groups to different pages after login with our customizable user login shortcode
* Personalize the experience of your site with the [user-data] shortcode
* UTF-8 support
* Front end user features: user registration form, login form, edit user profile form, account management, user listings or searches, user profiles and more!
* Back end user management features: add new fields, add new users, create and assign user levels / user roles, email settings and options
* Let users choose their level on registration (useful with paid memberships)
* One-click installer to quickly set up the basic front end user pages and functionality
* Available public functions for total control and conditional behavior (some programming experience suggested)

If you have existing members that you'd like to import into the plugin or if you'd like to export your current users to perform bulk updates, no need to worry. Front-End Only Users has both user import and user export functionality. Perform a user export to spreadsheet to get all of your user data, which you can then use for analytics in other software or to perform bulk user updates. And, if you have a lot of users that you need to add into the system, you can easily perform a user import from a spreadsheet, to get all users into the plugin in one shot.

= Front-End User Premium Features =

The premium version of Front-End Only Users includes lots of additional useful user management features such as:

* Front-End user emails: Email all of the users on your site, or email subsets of users on your site
* Facebook and Twitter integration: Ability for users to create and log in to accounts using Facebook or Twitter APIs
* PayPal & Stripe integration: Ability to charge users a one-time, annual, or monthly membership fee through PayPal or Stripe
* Create discount codes for the payments
* Ability to integrate WordPress users, so that WP users can create profiles, access restricted content, be given a specific frontend user level within this plugin, etc.
* User Levels: Ability to create different user levels and to specify a default user level for users to be set to when they register (created on the “Levels” tab). Different user level groups can have access to different user content, allowing for easy and effective user management.
* Different registration forms depending on user level, option to let users select their own level
* Add a captcha to the registration form
* Access to the one-click installer, which lets you create all of the pages necessary for a user membership site with one click
* Front end user WooCommerce integration: Autofill WooCommerce fields for logged-in users
* Front-end user MailChimp integration: Makes it so new front end users are automatically added to your MailChimp list/contacts
* Email confirmation: Require users to confirm their email address before they can log in.
* Ability to restrict pages: Gives you the option of restricting pages to groups of users in the sidebar of the page editor.
* Admin Approval of Users: Require users to be approved by an administrator in the WordPress back-end before they can log in.
* User Statistics: This feature allows you to gather information about frontend users and how they are using your site, as well as to see what pages each user has visited.
* Front end user import via spreadsheet and user export to spreadsheet

--------------------------------------------------------------

== Installation ==

1. Upload the 'front-end-only-users' folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

or

1. Go to the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress and click 'Add New'
2. Search for 'Front-End Only Users' and select 'Install Now'
3. Activate the plugin when prompted

= Getting Started =

Please note that you can type 'help' after any shortcode (in the admin) and it will display a list of that shortcodes available attributes and what each attribute does. (A conflict with some themes makes it so that you may need to be in Text/HTML mode, and not Visual, for this to work.) For example:

[register help

1. User registration:
    * Go to the 'Fields' tab and create/edit the fields you want in your registration form
    * Place the [register] shortcode in the content area of any page you've created
    * If desired, enable the "Create WordPress User" to have a WordPress user account automatically created and linked on registration (premium)
    * If desired, allow Facebook and Twitter account linking, so they can be used for login (premium)
    * Enable admin approval and email notifications (premium)

2. Logging in and out:
    * Use the [login] shortcode to display a login form on a page
    * In the 'Premium' area of the 'Options' tab, use the 'Login Options' setting to enable Twitter and Facebook login (premium)
    * Placing the [logout] shortcode on a page makes it so that, when a user visits that page, they are automatically logged out
    * Use the [login-logout-toggle] on a page to display a login form if someone isn't logged in, and a logout button if someone is logged in

3. To manually create a user:
    * Click on 'F-E Users' in the WordPress admin sidebar menu
    * Click on the 'Users' tab. The 'Add New User' area will be on the left side.
    * Fill in the appropriate fields
    * Click the 'Add New User' button

4. Restricting content:
    * Any text, etc. placed in between the [restricted] and [/restricted] shortcodes will only show to logged-in users
    * Use the 'Front-End Users' box at the top right of the page create/edit screen to restrict that page to a specific user level

5. User profile, user lists, user data and user search:
    * Place the [edit-profile] shortcode on a page to allow logged-in users to edit their profile information
    * Place the [user-list] shortcode on a page to display a list of users, which you can, if desired, restrict to only certain users
    * The [user-data] shortcode allows you to insert specific information about a user on a page
    * Use the [user-profile] shortcode (premium) to create a user profile page. Please note that this page acts as a template of the user profile. It requires a user ID in the URL to properly display profile information. This usually happens through linking from the [user-list] shortcode or some other linking.
    * Place the [user-search] shortcode on a page to display a user search form

6. One-Click Installer
    * We have also made available a one-click installer, which allows you to get all of the pages you need to create a complex membership site up in minutes
    * This can be enabled in the 'Dashboard' tab by clicking the 'Open One-Click Installer' button
    * Watch our tutorial video for more information, here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCNlsqYbqKw.

7. Customize your front-end users experience by making use of the many available settings and options, including user login time, WordPress user account linking, sign-up emails, crypt, email confirmation (premium), user admin approval (premium), user activity tracking (premium) and more.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= What's the complete list of plugin shortcodes? =
* Register Form: [register]
* Login Form: [login]
* Logout Form:[logout]
* Toggle:[login-logout-toggle]
* Edit Profile Form: [edit-profile]
* Edit Account Information: [account-details]
* Restricted Content: [restricted][/restricted]

Type the shortcode name and help (ex:[login help) in any WordPress page to get a complete list of the shortcode's attributes.

= How do I add fields for my users to fill out? =

On the admin page, go to the "Fields" tab. After creating fields, you can drag and drop them to change their order.

= How do I restrict content for logged-in or non-logged-in users? =
You can use the [restricted] shortcode to block sections from non-logged in users, as well as to block other sections from logged-in members.

To block content from non-logged in visitors, you'd simply wrap the content in [restricted][/restricted] tags:

[restricted]Content goes here[/restricted]

To block a portion of content from logged in users, it would looks like:

[restricted block_logged_in='Yes']Content goes here[/restricted]

For either tag, you can suppress the message that appears for blocked users if you want to hide content seamlessly by adding "no_message='Yes'" so:

[restricted no_message='Yes']Content goes here[/restricted]
= How do I redirect based on a user field? =

You need to add the following attributes to your [login] or [register] shortcodes: ‘redirect_field’: the field the redirect is based off of (ex. Gender) and ‘redirect_array_string’: a comma separated list of pages to redirect to (ex. Male => http: //ManPage.com, Female => http: //WomanPage.com)
= How do I display a user's first name on a page? =

You can use the [user-data field_name='First Name'] shortcode, assuming that you called your field "First Name" for a user's first name.
= How do I approve an user? =

Click on the user you want to approve to see their details and there should be a radio button at the top of the page to approve the user.

= How do I restrict content based on the privilege levels? =

To restrict content to a certain level(X) your shortcode would be: [restricted level='X']...content[/restricted]
For all levels above "X" level: [restricted minimum_level='X']...content[/restricted]
For all levels below "X" level: [restricted maximum_level='X']...content[/restricted]

= Once a user registers their information, is there a way to redirect them to a page that will have further instructions? =

You can add the attribute ‘redirect_page’ to the register tag to send newly registered users to a new page: [register redirect_page='http://www.example.com']

= When I go on the profile page, I see "You must be logged in to access this page." even though I'm already logged in. How can I fix this? =

Check the “Options” page, and make sure that 'Login Time' isn't blank. If it's blank, then you're only logged in for a second. Anything non-blank and higher than 0 should solve the problem.

= Is it possible to not the show message: "Sorry, this content is only for those whose FIELD is FIELD-value"? =

You can add the attribute [no_message='Yes'] to your shortcode, so it would look something like this: [restricted field_name='Name' field_value='Alex' no_message='Yes''/restricted]

= Is there a way to indicate to users that they are logged in? I know this can be added to a page using 'user-data', but is there a way to add it to the page header? =

You could add the [user-data] tag to your header file and wrap it in restricted tags so that only logged in users can see it.

= I can't seem to find an option that requires a user to confirm his email upon registration. How do I add this feature? =

To add the confirmation link to the email, you need to include the shortcode [confirmation-link] inside the body of your e-mail.

= How do I use the forgot password shortcode? =

You would want to create a separate page with the [forgot-password] shortcode, and then another page with the ‘confirm-forgot-password’ shortcode on it. For the [forgot-password] shortcode, you would then add an attribute ‘reset_email_url’ with a value set to whatever URL you're using for the [confirm-forgot-password] shortcode.

= How do I restrict and redirect a user to the login page when user is not logged in? =

Content can be restricted using the [restricted][/restricted] tag. Any content between the opening and closing tags will only be visible to those who are logged in. To redirect a user when the user in not logged in you would want to use the [login redirect_page='url'] shortcode where the url is the login page you want to redirect to.

= How do I customize the style of this plugin? I'd like to change the color of my button. Can you let me know how I can do that? =

You can customize the plugin by adding code to the "Custom CSS" box on the "Options" page. For example, if you want the button to be red you might try adding:

.ewd-feup-submit.pure-button.pure-button-primary {background: red;}

If you have the premium version, all colors, fonts, sizes, etc. can be customized through the "Styling" area of the "Options" tab.

= How do I translate the plugin into my language? =
A great place to start learning about how to translate a plugin is at the link below: <http://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/how-to-translate-a-wordpress-plugin>
Once translated, you'll need to put the translated mo- and po- files directly in the lang folder and make sure they are named properly for your localization.
If you do translate the plugin, other users would love to have access to the files in your language. You can send them to us at Contact@EtoileWebDesign.com, and we’ll be sure they’re included in a future release.

= What features are included in the premium version of the plugin =
* PayPal integration: Ability to charge users a one-time, annual, or monthly membership fee through PayPal
* Ability to integrate WordPress users, so that WP users can create profiles, access restricted content, be given an FEUP level, etc.
* Access to the one-click installer, which lets you create all of the pages necessary for a membership site with one click
* Email confirmation: Require users to confirm their e-mail address before they can log in.
* Admin Approval of Users: Require users to be approved by an administrator in the WordPress back-end before they can log in.
* User Levels: Ability to create different user levels and to specify a default user level for users to be set to when they register (created on the “Levels” tab)
